This summer, I am participating in Google Summer of Code, working on the [Book management project for Wikbooks/Wikisource](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Book_management) under Wikimedia with my mentors [Raylton P. Sousa](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Raylton_P._Sousa) and [Thomas PT](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Tpt). As the community bonding period is nearing its end, I think now is the best time for a blog-post about my experience with the program till now.

I was introduced to GSoC by my seniors at SDSLabs and especially to Wikimedia by [Aarti Dwivedi](http://aartindi.blogspot.in/) who had worked with Mediawiki during GSoC 2013.

Wikimedia is a huge organization both in terms of its code-base as well as developer community and people here are very encouraging towards newbies. I started with reading about [ways to contribute to Mediawiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/How_to_become_a_MediaWiki_hacker). Then I submitted patches for a few easy bugs and got a little comfortable with the code. I chose Book management from the list of proposed projects and drafted my proposal with Raylton's help. After that I started working on bugs related to my project. Whenever I fixed even an easiest bug, I felt great about having contributed something. I almost always found instant help whenever needed and that's what I loved the most about being involved with an open-source community. 

I was ecstatic when my proposal was accepted. We decided to use the pre-code time for properly [planning our work](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Book_management_2014). Raylton has been extremely supportive. We have tried to organize our ideas and decide what is most important and what can be left for later, finalized [mock-ups](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Book_management_2014/UX_Document), [technical details](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Book_management_2014/Technical_notes) and [timeline](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Jaindeepali/Proposal#Workflow) of the project. Our main aim is to get [Bookmanagerv2 extension](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:BookManagerv2) functioning and deployable. We have also thought of a lot of cool [features](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Book_management_2014/Features) to implement after that.

I am very excited to work on this project. I hope we find enough time to implement most of our ideas.
